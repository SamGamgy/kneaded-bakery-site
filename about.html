        <p>
          Kneaded Bakery began as a weekend ritual of baking sourdough for
          family and friends. Over time our passion for simple, wholesome food
          blossomed into a micro‑bakery nestled in Chesapeake, VA. We prepare
          each loaf, cookie and muffin by hand in our home kitchen in small
          batches to ensure quality and freshness.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Virginia cottage food operation, we are allowed to make and sell
          low‑risk, shelf‑stable baked goods that don’t require time or
          temperature control.  The exemption permits us to advertise online but
          prohibits taking orders or payments through this website.  That is
          why you’ll find photos, descriptions and price lists here, but no
          checkout—just a friendly invitation to get in touch to arrange your
          pickup.
        </p>
        <p>
          We label every item with our name, address, processing date and the
          required notice “NOT FOR RESALE – PROCESSED AND PREPARED WITHOUT
          STATE INSPECTION.”  This
          disclosure lets you know our products are produced in a home kitchen
          exempt from routine state inspections. We also repeat the statement on
          this website in keeping with Virginia Cottage Food Law guidance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond baking, we believe in community and connection. Each loaf and
          pastry we share is a small gesture of warmth and hospitality. We hope
          you taste that love in every bite.
